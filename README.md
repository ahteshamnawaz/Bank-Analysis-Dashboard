# Banking Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project

I recently built an end-to-end Banking Analytics Dashboard to analyze customer loans, repayments, and risk patterns across multiple years.

#  Key Insights from the Dashboard:
- Analyzed 39K+ customers with a total loan amount of 446M
- Average interest rate stands at 12.02%
- Tracked principal received (389M) vs revolving balance (532M)
- Compared funded amount vs revolving balance year-wise
- Identified loan distribution by verification status (Verified vs Not Verified)
- Visualized repayment performance by loan grade
- Monitored delinquency trends & collection recovery over time
- Analyzed loan status across home ownership types

# Skills & Tools Used:
Power BI
- Data modeling & DAX
- Interactive slicers & drill-downs
- KPI cards, bar charts, line charts & pie visuals
- This project helped me strengthen my understanding of financial data analysis, risk indicators, and business storytelling through dashboards.
 Open to feedback and discussions!
